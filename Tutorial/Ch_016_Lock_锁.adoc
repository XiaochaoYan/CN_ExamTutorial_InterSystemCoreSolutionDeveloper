使用情况 +

If your application needs to read one or more global nodes, and you do not want other processes to modify the values during the read operation, create shared locks for those nodes. +

If your application needs to modify one or more global nodes, and you do not want other processes to read these nodes during the modification, create exclusive locks for those nodes. +

Shared vs Exclusive + 

While one process owns an exclusive lock (with a given lock name), no other process can acquire any lock with that lock name. +

While one process owns a shared lock (with a given lock name), other processes can acquire shared locks with that lock name, but no other process can acquire an exclusive lock with that lock name. +

== 避免死锁 Deadlock +
Always include the timeout argument. +

Follow a strict protocol for the order in which you issue incremental LOCK commands. Deadlocks cannot occur as long as all processes follow the same order for lock names. A simple protocol is to add locks in collating sequence order. +

Use simple locking rather than incremental locking; that is, do not use the + operator. As noted earlier, with simple locking, the LOCK command first releases all previous locks held by the process. (In practice, however, simple locking is not often used.) +

If a deadlock occurs, you can resolve it by using the Management Portal or the ^LOCKTAB routine. See “Monitoring Locks” in the Monitoring Guide. +

I: Immediate unlock +

Immediately releases a lock, rather than waiting until the end of a transaction: +

Specifying “I” when unlocking a non-incremented (lock count 1) lock immediately releases the lock. By default, an unlock does not immediately release a non-incremented lock. Instead, when you unlock a non-incremented lock InterSystems IRIS maintains that lock in a delock state until the end of the transaction. Specifying “I” overrides this default behavior. +

Specifying “I” when unlocking an incremented lock (lock count > 1) immediately releases the incremental lock, decrementing the lock count by 1. This is the same behavior as a default unlock of an incremented lock. +



== Escalating Locks +
当一个 Process 创建了多于特定数量的 锁Lock 后（默认1000），所以 继承关系中的 Child 级别的锁 会被合并到上一层的 Parent 级别的锁 +

Note that only “E” locks are counted towards lock escalation. The following example applies both default (non-“E”) locks and “E” locks on the same variable.  +
